Overview

This Streamlit app visualises patient admission data using charts and metrics for demographics, admission details, and clinical scores. It reads processed CSV files generated by your ETL pipeline.

Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher installed
* Required Python packages installed: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `altair`

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas altair
```

Ensure the ETL output CSV files are saved inside the `etl_output` folder.

How to Run the Application

1. Run the ETL.py file to create dimension/fact tables if not already present.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the project root directory containing `app.py` and the `etl_output` folder.

5. Run the Streamlit app using the command:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

4. Your default web browser should open automatically with the dashboard. If not, open the URL shown in the terminal (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).

Notes

* Make sure the CSV files in `etl_output` are up to date and correctly formatted.
